                        I hope all my Mohyal brothers and sisters are in good health and doing great in this New Year.
                        As
                        we welcome the vibrant festival of Basant Panchami, symbolizing knowledge, prosperity, and the
                        arrival of spring, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all Mohyal brothers and sisters. May Maa
                        Saraswati bless our Community with wisdom and enlightenment.<br>
                        January has been a cold month and to ensure the continuity of our efforts and discussions
                        despite
                        the weather, we conducted an online meeting to address ongoing matters of importance.<br>
                        Looking ahead, I am pleased to announce an upcoming meeting at the GMS office in February. I
                        earnestly request all Presidents and Secretaries of all the affiliated Mohyal Sabhas to attend
                        this
                        meeting. Together, we will address significant issues concerning widow empowerment and education
                        for
                        Mohyal children. Not even a single Mohyal child should be deprived of education, because of
                        insufficient funds. Also we will discuss various ways and methods to empower the widows of our
                        Community, so that they can have a stable and dignified life. These are critical areas where we
                        must
                        channel our collective efforts to uplift and support underprivileged members of our
                        Community.<br>
                        Let us continue to work with dedication and try to live up to our shared vision of ensuring no
                        member of our Mohyal family is left behind. I look forward to your valuable inputs and
                        participation.
                        Wishing good health and happiness to each one of you.<br><br>
                        Yours affectionately,<br>
